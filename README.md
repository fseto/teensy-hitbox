# Teensy Hitbox

Stickless arcade controller for Teensy microcontroller.

## Notes

All buttons are connected as internal pull-ups as this simplifies the wiring immensely.

Conflicting directions are supported so you can do things such as press down and back and then press up/forward without releasing any buttons to perform charge moves.
